# Problem Statement: Analyzing Pizza Sales Data to Improve Business Performance

In this project, we aim to gain valuable insights into our pizza business performance by analyzing key performance indicators (KPIs) and visualizing the data through various charts. The primary focus is on understanding the sales trends, customer preferences, and identifying opportunities for improvement. We have outlined the specific requirements for KPI calculation and chart creation as follows:

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Requirement:**
1. Total Revenue: Calculate the sum of the total price of all pizza orders to understand the overall revenue generated.
2. Average Order Value: Compute the average amount spent per order by dividing the total revenue by the total number of orders, providing insights into customer spending behavior.
3. Total Pizzas Sold: Determine the total quantity of all pizzas sold to gauge overall product demand.
4. Total Orders: Count the total number of orders placed to understand the volume of customer transactions.
5. Average Pizzas Per Order: Calculate the average number of pizzas sold per order by dividing the total number of pizzas sold by the total number of orders, revealing customer preferences and purchase habits.

**Charts Requirement:**
1. Daily Trend for Total Orders: Create a bar chart displaying the daily trend of total orders over a specific time period. This chart will uncover any patterns or fluctuations in order volumes on a daily basis.
2. Monthly Trend for Total Orders: Generate a line chart illustrating the monthly trend of total orders throughout the day. This chart will identify peak hours or periods of high order activity.
3. Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category: Develop a pie chart to showcase the distribution of sales across different pizza categories. This chart will provide insights into the popularity of various pizza categories and their contribution to overall sales.
4. Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size: Create a pie chart representing the percentage of sales attributed to different pizza sizes. This chart will help understand customer preferences for pizza sizes and their impact on sales.
5. Total Pizzas Sold by Pizza Category: Design a funnel chart to present the total number of pizzas sold for each pizza category. This chart will facilitate the comparison of sales performance among different pizza categories.
6. Top 5 Best Sellers by Revenue, Total Quantity, and Total Orders: Create a bar chart highlighting the top 5 best-selling pizzas based on revenue, total quantity sold, and total number of orders. This chart will identify the most popular pizza options.
7. Bottom 5 Best Sellers by Revenue, Total Quantity, and Total Orders: Develop a bar chart showcasing the bottom 5 worst-selling pizzas based on revenue, total quantity sold, and total number of orders. This chart will identify underperforming or less popular pizza options.

By analyzing these KPIs and visualizing the data through various charts, we will gain valuable insights to optimize our business strategies, enhance customer experiences, and drive growth in our pizza sales.

With this delightful journey through pizza sales data, we'll uncover valuable insights to enrich our business strategies, surprise our customers with personalized offerings, and create memorable experiences. So, let's savor this adventure and make our pizza business a taste sensation for all! üçïüòä
