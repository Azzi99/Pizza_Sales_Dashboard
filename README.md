In this project, we aim to gain valuable insights into our pizza business performance by analyzing key performance indicators (KPIs) and visualizing the data through various charts. The primary focus is on understanding the sales trends, customer preferences, and identifying opportunities for improvement. We have outlined the specific requirements for KPI calculation and chart creation as follows:

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Requirement:
1. Total Revenue: Calculate the sum of the total price of all pizza orders to understand the overall revenue generated.
2. Average Order Value: Compute the average amount spent per order by dividing the total revenue by the total number of orders, providing insights into customer spending behavior.
3. Total Pizzas Sold: Determine the total quantity of all pizzas sold to gauge overall product demand.
4. Total Orders: Count the total number of orders placed to understand the volume of customer transactions.
5. Average Pizzas Per Order: Calculate the average number of pizzas sold per order by dividing the total number of pizzas sold by the total number of orders, revealing customer preferences and purchase habits.

## Charts Requirement:
1. Daily Trend for Total Orders: Create a bar chart displaying the daily trend of total orders over a specific time period. This chart will uncover any patterns or fluctuations in order volumes on a daily basis.
2. Monthly Trend for Total Orders: Generate a line chart illustrating the monthly trend of total orders throughout the day. This chart will identify peak hours or periods of high order activity.
3. Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category: Develop a pie chart to showcase the distribution of sales across different pizza categories. This chart will provide insights into the popularity of various pizza categories and their contribution to overall sales.
4. Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size: Create a pie chart representing the percentage of sales attributed to different pizza sizes. This chart will help understand customer preferences for pizza sizes and their impact on sales.
5. Total Pizzas Sold by Pizza Category: Design a funnel chart to present the total number of pizzas sold for each pizza category. This chart will facilitate the comparison of sales performance among different pizza categories.
6. Top 5 Best Sellers by Revenue, Total Quantity, and Total Orders: Create a bar chart highlighting the top 5 best-selling pizzas based on revenue, total quantity sold, and total number of orders. This chart will identify the most popular pizza options.
7. Bottom 5 Best Sellers by Revenue, Total Quantity, and Total Orders: Develop a bar chart showcasing the bottom 5 worst-selling pizzas based on revenue, total quantity sold, and total number of orders. This chart will identify underperforming or less popular pizza options.

  By analyzing these KPIs and visualizing the data through various charts, we will gain valuable insights to optimize our business strategies, enhance customer experiences, and drive growth in our pizza sales.

## Project Insights:

- **Busiest Days and Times**: The project experiences the highest number of orders on weekends, particularly Friday and Sunday evenings. This trend indicates the peak demand during leisure time and could help in optimizing resource allocation during these periods.

- **Monthly Order Trends**: The months of July and January show the maximum number of orders, indicating potential seasonal patterns or special occasions that drive higher customer engagement. Understanding these patterns can aid in planning marketing campaigns and managing inventory effectively.

- **Sales Performance**: The Classic Category stands out as the top-performing category, contributing to the highest sales and total orders. Additionally, Large Size Pizza is the most popular size, further driving the overall sales performance.

- **Best Sellers**: The Thai Chicken Pizza emerges as the clear winner in terms of revenue generation, showcasing its popularity among customers. The Classic Deluxe Pizza, on the other hand, leads in terms of total quantities sold and total orders, highlighting its widespread appeal and consistent demand.

- **Worst Sellers**: On the other end of the spectrum, the Brie Carre Pizza is the least revenue-generating item, indicating potential areas for improvement or marketability. Surprisingly, the Classic Deluxe Pizza, which performs exceptionally well in other areas, seems to have the lowest contribution in terms of total quantities sold and total orders, warranting further investigation and strategizing.

## Conclusion:

In conclusion, the project insights reveal valuable opportunities for enhancing our pizza delivery service:

1. **Optimized Resource Allocation**: With peak demand on weekends, particularly Friday and Sunday evenings, we should allocate additional resources during these times for efficient order processing.
   
3. **Seasonal Marketing Campaigns**: Targeted marketing efforts during the high-demand months of July and January can capitalize on seasonal trends and boost customer engagement.

4. **Promote Classic Category and Large Size Pizzas**: Focusing on the Classic Category and Large Size Pizzas will further drive sales and total orders.

5. **Enhance Marketability of Low Performers**: The Brie Carre Pizza needs improvement in marketability. Gather customer feedback to identify areas for enhancement.
